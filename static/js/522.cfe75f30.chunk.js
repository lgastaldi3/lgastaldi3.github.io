Developing the model on Google Colab meant access to only a single GPU, which constrained the dataset size and required careful management of batch sizes and training iterations to make meaningful progress. With just 10MB of training data available, the model was highly susceptible to overfitting and noise, making it difficult to generalize or produce fluent text reliably. To mitigate this, letter-based tokenization paired with convolutional layers was used to improve representation efficiency. Another key difficulty was evaluating output quality \u2014 the model's responses often hovered between plausible and incoherent, and without large-scale benchmarks, progress was assessed manually through qualitative analysis and tuning. These constraints demanded a highly iterative and resource-aware development process."}],SocialSharingHeading:"Share This",SocialSharing:[{id:1,name:"LinkedIn",icon:(0,f.jsx)(p.Wjy,{}),url:"https://linkedin.com/lgastaldi3/"}]},RelatedProject:{title:"Related Projects",Projects:[]}},thrifti:{ProjectHeader:{title:"Thrifti",publishDate:"January 2024 \u2013 May 2024",tags:"Mobile App, Marketplace, React Native, TypeScript, Flask, Pinecone, Firebase, PostHog, Docker, GCP, Figma, ExpoGo"},ProjectImages:[{id:1,title:"Thrifti main screen",img:c},{id:2,title:"Thrifti item listing screenshot",img:g},{id:3,title:"Thrifti chat screenshot",img:m}],ProjectInfo:{ClientHeading:"About Involvement",CompanyInfo:[{id:1,title:"Client/Company",details:"Independent Group Project"},{id:2,title:"Role",details:"Backend lead \u2014 responsible for Firebase integration, vector database search via Pinecone, and full backend system design and deployment"}],ObjectivesHeading:"Objective",ObjectivesDetails:"Thrifti is a full-featured mobile marketplace app designed to make peer-to-peer resale safer, easier, and more sustainable for college students.
